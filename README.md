### Assignment 
Attached is a CSV file of UK energy market data. It contains 2 price columns labelled DAM and SIP. DAM is short for day-ahead-market, SIP is short for system imbalance price. These are the two key prices a battery can access when it's operating in the UK, so we spend a lot of time thinking about these data.

The purpose of the exercise is to get a chance to see you write some python - we're not worried about earth-shaking insights and definitely aren't expecting any substantive models to be produced. The ideal output should contain:
- a couple of statistics describing the data
- a visualisation or two to illustrate interesting trends
- define at least one class and one function for the analysis/model, so we can see how you'd format this code   

The exercise should take around 3 hours to complete - feel free to leave comments describing other things you'd have liked to try but didn't get to.

Feel free to share the results in your preferred format - jupyter notebook, whatever works for you.
